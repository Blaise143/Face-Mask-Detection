# Face-Mask-Detection (92%  Accuracy)
**Note:** For a nicer rendering of the notebook, click on this [link to NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/Blaise143/Face-Mask-Image-Classification/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb).

In this project, I used a Convolutional neural-network architecture using the PyTorch framework on image data to create a model that can detect whether or not an image has:
* a fully covered mask
* a partially covered mask
* a non covered face
* not a face at all
## Concepts used in this project:
  #### Deep Learning
   - Convolutional Neural Networks
  #### Data Visualization:
   - Matplotlib

## Potential Improvements to this project
  - Setting a learning rate decay
  - decreasing the learning rate

# HAPPY CODING!!!
